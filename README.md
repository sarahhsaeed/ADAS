# ‚ú® ADAS Project

Welcome to our NTI Graduation Project repository üñêüèª! We are thrilled and proud to present our "Advanced Driver Assistance System" (ADAS), an innovative solution designed to enhance the driving experience and improve safety on the road.

## ‚≠êIntroduction

Our ADAS project aims to revolutionize the way we interact with vehicles, bringing advanced technologies and intelligent features to the forefront of modern driving. With a focus on user-friendly controls, and real-time monitoring.

## ‚≠êFeatures and Functionalities

### Three Different Modes of Operation:

- Normal Mode: Control the car's speed and direction using a mobile application while having the option to switch between different modes.
- Adaptive Cruise Control Mode: The car automatically adjusts its speed based on the distance from the object in front of it.
- Smart Driving Mode: The car intelligently slows down when approaching an object, and an ultrasonic sensor scans the environment to select the optimal path.

### Advanced Safety Features:

- Lane Departure Warning (LDW): Alerts the driver when the vehicle deviates from its lane.
- Lane Keep Assist (LKA): Automatically helps the driver to stay within the lane.
- Blind Spot Detection: Warns the driver about vehicles in the blind spots.
- Rain Detection: Detects rain and adapts the car's behavior accordingly.
- Rear Lights System: Enhances visibility and safety while driving in different conditions.

### Mobile Application:

Control various aspects of the car, including speed, direction, and mode selection, through a user-friendly mobile application.

### GUI Dashboard:

A graphical user interface (GUI) represents the car's dashboard, providing real-time information such as distance, speed, and system status.

## ‚≠êTechnologies and Components Used

To bring this project to life, we utilized a combination of cutting-edge technologies and carefully selected components:

- STM32F401RCT6 microcontroller (Cortex M4 ARM-based microprocessor)
- Ultrasonic sensors
- Raspberry Pi (4B)
- Servo motors
- DC motors & Motor Driver
- Rain Sensor

## ‚≠êDevelopment Tools

For development, we used the STM Cube IDE, a powerful integrated development environment for STM32 microcontrollers.

The system's tasks and scheduling are managed using FreeRTOS.

## ‚≠êSystem Architecture

### How Our System Works:

- Communication between the ARM microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi is established using the UART communication protocol.
- The STM32F401RCT6 microcontroller utilizes various peripherals such as a Timer (PWM mode & ICU mode), GPIO, Systick, RCC, NVIC, and USART.
- All system features are controlled through the mobile application.
- The GUI displays real-time information such as distance and speed and other visuals that alert the driver.
